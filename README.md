### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (data) scientist, mathematician, and researcher interested in developing methods and models for understanding infectious disease transmission and pathogen evolution. Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Washington in Applied Mathematics in Trevor Bedford's group at Fred Hutch ([@blab](https://github.com/blab))
