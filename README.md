### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist, mathematician, and researcher interested in developing methods and models for understanding infectious disease transmission and pathogen evolution. Currently, I'm doing my PhD at the University of Washington in Applied Mathematics in Trevor Bedford's group at Fred Hutch ([@blab](https://github.com/blab))
